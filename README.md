Hi! My name is Audra
====================


Software Developer
------------------

I’ve been learning code for the past decade after discovering a personal obsession with digging into programs, settings, and design options to figure out how things work and how to make them do that one cool thing. Backend development is my happy place, and Java has been my copilot. I’ve dipped into full stack development to make everything work together, and through every project, I’ve added some new language or tech to my toolbelt.
